Hello and welcome to my profile,  
my name is Kim Hayo (@notepass) and I'm mostly working with Java and spring related projects (Altought I occasianally tip my toes into other programming languages such as PHP, JS and C#).  
  
On a public project side (OSS), you can find a lot of tape related stuff (e.g. the [notaping](https://gitlab.com/notaping) project for storing stuff on tapes and [mt-win](https://gitlab.com/notepass/mt-win)
to control tape devices under windows like you can with mt-st under *nix). Every now and then I will also contribute to other projects I use if I find something to add to them.  
  
On the private project side (closed source), there are also a few projects (former or running):
- [bachgold](http://bachgold.de): A small multi-blog, sinngle tenant web-app for a friend. Currently written in PHP, a spring boot rewrite is in progress (I'm aware it is overkill - But private projects are for learning)
- [bergwerklabs](http://bergwerklabs.de): A former project created by a team I was part of. It was a minecraft minigame network, with about 1500 or 2000 users at peak time. I mostly did server admninistration and created ingame and CLI tools to help with various tasks, including deployments and server access


Most of the work I do can be found on my [Gitlab page](https://gitlab.com/notepass), so head over there if you like to. If you want to shoot me a mail, you can contact me under [oss@notepass.de](mailto:oss@notepass.de).
